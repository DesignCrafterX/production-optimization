# production-optimization
 This dataset provides 52 weeks of tire production data, tracking key metrics like defect rate, machine downtime, production efficiency, costs, and revenue. It helps analyze productivity trends and optimize resource allocation.
Overview
This file contains weekly data for a tire manufacturing plant over a period of 52 weeks. Each row represents a week's worth of production metrics, including information about production efficiency, defect rate, machine downtime, labor hours, and costs. The data is structured in a tabular format with the following columns:

Data Structure
Columns:
Week: The week number (from 1 to 52) representing each week in the production year.
Total Tires Produced: The total number of tires produced in the week.
Defect Rate (%): The percentage of defective tires produced during the week.
Machine Downtime (hrs): The total number of hours machines were non-operational due to breakdowns or maintenance.
Production Efficiency (%): The production efficiency for the week, expressed as a percentage.
Labor Hours: The total number of labor hours worked during the week.
Material Cost (INR): The total material cost in INR (Indian Rupees) for producing tires during the week.
Labor Cost (INR): The total cost of labor for the week in INR.
Total Cost (INR): The sum of the material and labor costs for the week.
Revenue (INR): The total revenue generated from the sale of the produced tires for the week.
Example Data Row:
Week 1:
Total Tires Produced: 1000
Defect Rate (%): 2%
Machine Downtime (hrs): 5 hours
Production Efficiency (%): 90%
Labor Hours: 160 hours
Material Cost (INR): 50,000 INR
Labor Cost (INR): 20,000 INR
Total Cost (INR): 70,000 INR
Revenue (INR): 100,000 INR
Purpose
This dataset is used for:

Analyzing production trends: Assessing how factors like defect rate, machine downtime, and efficiency affect overall production output and costs.
Labor and machine utilization: Understanding how labor hours and machine downtime impact production efficiency.
Cost analysis: Evaluating material and labor costs in relation to total revenue and determining profitability.
Identifying improvement areas: Examining data to propose adjustments like labor reallocation, staggered shifts, and machine maintenance scheduling to optimize productivity.
Potential Uses:
Production Efficiency Analysis: Use the data to calculate and track labor productivity (tires produced per labor hour).
Cost Management: Evaluate how material and labor costs influence the overall production cost and profitability.
Machine Downtime Optimization: Analyze machine downtime trends to propose maintenance improvements.
Defect Reduction: Monitor defect rates and identify correlations with machine downtime or production efficiency.
Data Handling:
This data can be imported into spreadsheet software (e.g., Excel) or used for further analysis in data visualization or statistical tools (e.g., Python, R).
