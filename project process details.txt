Work to be Done


Trend Analysis
Weekly Production Trends: Visualize production levels over the 52 weeks to identify peaks and troughs in output.
Defect Rate Trends: Analyze how the defect rate fluctuates week-to-week, identifying any seasonal patterns or issues.
Machine Downtime Trends: Track downtime across weeks to determine if there are specific periods of high downtime, indicating maintenance issues.


2. Cost Analysis
Cost per Tire: Calculate the total production cost per tire produced to assess cost efficiency.
Material vs. Labor Costs: Analyze the proportion of material costs versus labor costs to understand where expenditures are concentrated and where potential savings may be found.
Cost Trends: Assess how total costs change over the year and identify any correlations with production efficiency or defect rates.


3. Efficiency Analysis
Production Efficiency: Calculate average weekly production efficiency and analyze factors affecting it (e.g., machine downtime, defect rates).
Labor Productivity: Evaluate the output per labor hour to assess worker productivity. This can be calculated by dividing total tires produced by total labor hours.


4. Defect Analysis
Root Cause Analysis: Investigate weeks with high defect rates to identify possible causes (e.g., machine settings, material quality, operator error).
Cost of Quality: Analyze the cost associated with defects (rework, scrap) to quantify the impact on overall production costs.


5. Forecasting
Predict Future Production: Use historical data to create forecasts for future production levels, allowing for better planning and resource allocation.
Demand Forecasting: If market demand data is available, compare production output against demand trends to identify any gaps.


6. Comparative Analysis
Benchmarking: Compare your production metrics against industry standards or competitors to identify areas for improvement.
Best and Worst Weeks: Identify the best-performing and worst-performing weeks to analyze what practices led to successes or failures.


7. Visual Data Analysis
Dashboards: Create dashboards to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) such as production volume, defect rates, and costs, facilitating easier decision-making.
Histograms/Graphs: Use graphs and histograms to illustrate the distribution of defect rates and production efficiencies over the year.


8. Process Improvement Initiatives
Lean Manufacturing Techniques: Based on the analysis, implement lean principles to reduce waste and improve efficiency (e.g., Just-In-Time inventory, 5S).
Continuous Improvement Projects: Launch projects targeting specific areas for improvement, such as reducing downtime or defect rates.


9. Impact of External Factors
Seasonal Effects: Analyze whether certain times of the year lead to increased defects or decreased production, possibly correlating with supply chain issues or market demands.
Supplier Analysis: If material cost data varies significantly, evaluate the impact of different suppliers on production costs and quality.


10. Resource Allocation
Labor and Machine Utilization: Analyze if there are optimal staffing or machine schedules to maximize production without overworking resources.
Maintenance Scheduling: Use downtime data to inform preventive maintenance schedules, reducing unplanned downtime.
